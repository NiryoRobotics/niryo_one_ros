This repository contains all ROS packages used on Niryo One (Raspberry Pi 3 - Xubuntu for ARM).

## How to use Niryo One with a graphical interface ?

You can [download Niryo One Studio](https://niryo.com/download/?utm_source=github) (Linux, Windows and MacOS compatible).

## How to install Niryo One ROS packages on your computer (x86) - Simulation Mode

Requirements :
* Ubuntu 16.04
* ROS kinetic  (other versions are not supported)

First install ROS kinetic "Desktop-Full" (tutorial [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)).

You'll need to install some additional ROS packages :
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher ros-kinetic-moveit ros-kinetic-manipulation-msgs ros-kinetic-rosbridge-suite ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers
```
Create a catkin workspace and clone Niryo One ROS stack :
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros.git .
```
Build the packages :
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
Don't forget to use those commands before you try to launch anything (you can add them in your .bashrc) :
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
You can now launch Rviz with Niryo One (only display mode with some cursors to move the joints):
```
roslaunch niryo_one_description display.launch
```

You can also launch the complete Niryo One ROS Stack instead, which you can control from Niryo One Studio.
```
roslaunch niryo_one_bringup desktop_rviz_simulation.launch
```

The main differences between this launch file and the launch file executed on Raspberry Pi 3 (rpi\_setup.launch) is that the hardware functionalities are disabled, and you get a 3D simulation view with Rviz.

Note that Niryo One ROS packages have been developed with **ROS kinetic, on Ubuntu 16.04**. Other ROS versions and OS distributions are not supported.
