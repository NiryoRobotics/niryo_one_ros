You can [download Niryo One Studio](https://niryo.com/download/?utm_source=github) (Linux, Windows and MacOS compatible).

## How to install Niryo One ROS packages on your computer (x86) - Simulation Mode

Requirements :
* Ubuntu 16.04
* ROS kinetic  (other versions are not supported)

First install ROS kinetic "Desktop-Full" (tutorial [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)).

You'll need to install some additional ROS packages :
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher ros-kinetic-moveit ros-kinetic-rosbridge-suite ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers ros-kinetic-tf2-web-republisher
```
You'll also need to install an additional Python module :
```
sudo -H pip install jsonpickle
```
Create a catkin workspace and clone Niryo One ROS stack :
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros.git .
```
Build the packages :
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
Don't forget to use those commands before you try to launch anything (you can add them in your .bashrc) :
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
You can now launch Rviz with Niryo One (only display mode with some cursors to move the joints):
```
roslaunch niryo_one_description display.launch
```

You can also launch the complete Niryo One ROS Stack instead, which you can control from Niryo One Studio.
```
roslaunch niryo_one_bringup desktop_rviz_simulation.launch
```

The main differences between this launch file and the launch file executed on Raspberry Pi 3B (rpi\_setup.launch) is that the hardware functionalities are disabled, and you get a 3D simulation view with Rviz.

Note that Niryo One ROS packages have been developed with **ROS kinetic, on Ubuntu 16.04**. Other ROS versions and OS distributions are not supported.


## :sparkles: How to use Niryo One in Gazebo
You'll need to install some additional ROS packages :
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control
```

You can now launch Gazebo with Niryo One:
```
roslaunch niryo_one_gazebo gazebo_niryo_one.launch
```

## :bug: Niryo One with Gripper
Theres a new urdf file that loads gripper onto Niryo One in Gazebo. The following command launches Niryo One with gripper and related controllers
```bash
roslaunch niryo_one_gazebo gazebo_niryo_one.launch without_gripper:=false
```

Thanks to the `gazebo_grasp_plugin` from @JenniferBuehler 's `gazebo-pkgs`, you should now be able to perform and visualise simple pick and place operations in Gazebo. 


Currently our repo only supports gazebo visualizations. In order to visualize objects and develop a pipeline in Rviz, you need to clone the entire [gazebo-pkgs](https://github.com/JenniferBuehler/gazebo-pkgs) and follow the instructions and tutorials found in their [wiki](https://github.com/JenniferBuehler/gazebo-pkgs/wiki/Installation).

> :exclamation: In case you run into issues while trying to build the `gazebo_grasp_plugin`s on ROS Kinetc, please follow these intructions in issue [#10](https://github.com/hsrwrobotics/niryo_one_ros/issues/10#issue-967215655) :exclamation:

---

(Optional) After you install ROS packages and execute catkin_make you still have some installation steps if you want to use Blockly ("Niryo Blocks" on Niryo One Studio).

Make sure that you have a recent nodejs version (not the default installed one)
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Install node modules in the blockly_code_generator directory (where you can find package.json) and create an executable.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/niryo_one_user_interface/blockly_code_generator
npm install
sudo npm link
```

That's it, you have now all the Niryo One functionalities ready to be used.
