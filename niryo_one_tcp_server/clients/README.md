### Description


Those clients should be preferred (most of the time) rather than developing directly on te robot for most usage.
<br>It's easier for developer to interact with the robot, developing / testing their software directly on their computer and do not require any ROS skills.

**Notes:** The TCP 'stack' uses the underlying python_api packages, if you prefer to interact directly with this API (on the robot), please refer to [this manual](https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros/tree/master/niryo_one_python_api).

### Available TCP clients
