# Niryo One Gazebo
This package contains launch files to start Niryo One and related ROS parameters in Gazebo.

## Launch files
### gazebo_niryo_one
Loads the Niryo One urdf model in Gazebo along with the necessary controllers. By default, the empty world is loaded. 

A new `bringup_minimal` launch file was created that loads the ROS parameters required for simulations.

Use `world_name` argument to load other worlds of your choice.  Remember to provide full apth to the world file. For example to load the stage_4.world provided along with this package
```
roslaunch niryo_one_gazebo gazebo_niryo_one.launch world_name:=/home/$(USER)/$(catkin_ws)/src/niryo_one_ros/niryo_one_gazebo/worlds/turtlebot3_stage_4.world
```

### gazebo_niryo_display
Loads the Niryo One urdf model in an empty world in Gazebo. This is only for visualization purposes, and may be removed in future releases.

### rviz_gazebo_niryo_one
This loads the Niryo One model in both Gazebo and Rviz, along with the Moveit planner. This is in fact based on the `demo_gazebo.launch` that is normally auto-generated by MoveIt Setup Assisstant
